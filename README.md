# FBC-2022-Spring-CTF
Capture The Flag (CTF) competition prepared for Fallbrook Cyber, Spring 2022

![SCYCA Logo](.resources/Logo-Full-black-JPG.jpg)

## Welcome!!
This CTF is compromised of 30 challenges, with 6 problems per each of the 5 sections. For the newer players out there this is referring to the standard 5 CTF sections: web exploitation (webex), binary exploitation (binex), forensics, networking, and cryptography (crypto). The problems increase in difficulty as you progress through the point ratings with harder or more intricate problems awarding more points. Each problem has a series of hints that will get you 90% of the way to the answer if you choose to use them. The competition organizers have decided to leave these hints free for your use as the root purpose is of course to teach the skills and techniques to you. Each challenge will still, however, require a fair bit of effort from the participant to solve.

Competition opens at 1500, at the start of the first practice of the year, 7 January 2022 and runs until the start of our last practice of the season on 20 May 2022. The goal is for you as the participant to take as much as possible away from this, aside from just the cool prizes ;)

## Prizes
1st Place - TBD<br>
2nd Place - TBD<br>
3rd Place - TBD<br>

**Tie breaks: **If there is a tie for a position on the scoreboard based on total points the tie will be decided by who achieved that amount of points first.
